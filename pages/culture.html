      <h2>Onam Festival</h2>
      <p>
        Onam is an annual Hindu festival, which usually falls between August –
        September, and is celebrated for ten days. In India’s southern state of
        Kerala, Onam is considered the state festival. It commemorates New
        Year’s Day and is also recognized as a harvest festival. While
        predominantly a Kerala festival, regions in other states, including
        Uttar Pradesh (Balia and Baway), Gujarat (Bharuch), and Maharashtra also
        honor its significance, while Malayali’s or Keralites across the world
        celebrate from afar. As like many other Hindu holidays, there are
        multiple legends of why a particular celebration occurs and what the
        religious significance is. The most common is the story of King
        Mahabali’s devotion and selflessness.
